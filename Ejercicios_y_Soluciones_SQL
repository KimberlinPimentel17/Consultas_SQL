# Ejercicio 1 
# Show the employee's first_name and last_name, a "num_orders" column with a count of the orders taken, and a column called
# "Shipped" that displays "On Time" if the order shipped_date is less or equal to the required_date, "Late" if the order shipped 
# late. Order by employee last_name, then by first_name, and then descending by number of orders.

# Solution
SELECT employees.first_name,
		employees.last_name,
        count (orders.order_id) as num_orders,
        (
          Case 
          when orders.shipped_date <= orders.required_date then "On Time"
          else "Late"
          End
          ) as shipped 
from orders join employees on employees.employee_id = orders.employee_id
group by 
	employees.first_name,
    employees.last_name,
    shipped
order by
	employees.last_name,
    employees.first_name,
    num_orders desc
