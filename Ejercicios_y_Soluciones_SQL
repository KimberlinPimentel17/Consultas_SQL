#Show the employee's first_name and last_name, a "num_orders" column with a count of the orders taken, and a column called "Shipped" that displays "On Time" 
# if the order shipped_date is less or equal to the required_date, "Late" if the order shipped late. Order by employee last_name, then by first_name, and then descending by number of orders.
